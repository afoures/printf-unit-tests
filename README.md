# Unit-tests for ft_printf - 42
I took [real_printf](https://github.com/MrJe/real_printf) created by [MrJe](https://github.com/MrJe), and I added some other tests.

## Getting Started

### Installation

In your ft_printf repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/afoures/ftprintf-unit-tests
```
**DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE REPO OR THE SCRIPT MAY NOT WORK FOR ALL THE TESTS**

### Running script

Run the script directly in your ft_printf repo
```sh
sh ftprintf-unit-tests/unit-tests.sh (option)
```

You should know that :
+ Some test are based on my personal implementation, so some test will maybe not works for you (I'm talking about %b, %r, color).
+ There is a lot of undefined behavior in this script.
